    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is just a recipe of a chocolate cake</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> All-Purpose Flour: 4 tablespoons </li>
        <li> Sugar: 2 tablespoons </li>
        <li> Unsweetened Cocoa Powder: 2 tablespoons </li>
        <li> Baking Powder: 1/4 teaspoon </li>
        <li> Milk: 3 tablespoons </li>
        <li> Vegetable Oil: 1 tablespoon </li>
        <li> Vanilla Extract: 2 drops </li>
        <li> Chocolate Chips: 1 tablespoon (optional, but highly recommended for a gooey center) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Mix Dry: Grab your favorite standard-sized ceramic mug. Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Stir with a fork until there are no clumps. </li>
        <li> Mix Wet: Add the milk, oil, and vanilla. Whisk with the fork until the batter is smooth. </li>
        <li> The Secret Heart: Drop the chocolate chips right into the center of the batter. Don't stir them in; let them sink naturally to create a molten core. </li>
        <li> Microwave: Cook on high for 90 seconds.(Note: Every microwave is different. If the top looks wet, give it another 10–15 seconds.) </li>
        <li> Cool: Let it sit for at least 2 minutes. This is the hardest part, but it finishes the cooking process and prevents you from burning your tongue! </li>
    </ol>
