    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is just a recipe for a pizza</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm Water: 1/3 cup (about 80ml) </li>
        <li> Sugar: 1/4 teaspoon (to feed the yeast) </li>
        <li> Active Dry Yeast: 3/4 teaspoon </li>
        <li> All-Purpose Flour: 1 cup (plus a little extra for dusting) </li>
        <li> Salt: 1/2 teaspoon </li>
        <li> Olive Oil: 1 teaspoon </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Bloom the Yeast: In a small bowl, mix the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it looks foamy. </li>
        <li> Mix: In a medium bowl, stir the flour and salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir with a spoon until a shaggy ball forms. </li>
        <li> Knead: Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Knead it for about 3–5 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. </li>
        <li> Rise: Lightly oil your bowl, put the dough back in, and cover it with a warm damp cloth. Let it rest for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Preheat: While the dough rests, crank your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a baking sheet, put it in the oven now so it gets hot. </li>
        <li> Shape & Bake: Roll or stretch the dough into a 10-inch circle. Carefully place it on the hot baking sheet (or parchment paper). </li>
        <li> Toppings: Add a thin layer of sauce, a handful of mozzarella, and your favorite toppings. </li>
        <li> Cook: Bake for 8–12 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. </li>
    </ol>
