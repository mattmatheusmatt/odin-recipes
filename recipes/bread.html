    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hey this is just a bread recipe</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> All-Purpose or Bread Flour: 1 cup </li>
        <li> Warm Water: 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon </li>
        <li> Instant Yeast: 1/2 teaspoon </li>
        <li> Salt: 1/4 teaspoon </li>
        <li> Honey or Sugar: 1/4 teaspoon (optional, helps browning) </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Mix: In a medium bowl, stir the flour, salt, and yeast together. Pour in the warm water (and honey if using). Stir with a spoon until a sticky dough ball forms and no dry flour remains. </li>
        <li> First Rise: Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap. Let it sit in a warm spot for 1.5 to 2 hours. It should double in size and look bubbly. </li>
        <li> Shape: Scrape the dough onto a floured surface. Fold the edges into the center a few times to form a ball. Place it on a small piece of parchment paper. </li>
        <li> Second Rise: Let the ball rest for 30 minutes while you preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). </li>
        <li> Bake: Slide the parchment paper with the dough onto a baking sheet. Just before closing the oven door, pour half a cup of water into that empty tray on the bottom rack (this creates steam for a crispy crust!). </li>
        <li> Timing: Bake for 20–25 minutes until the top is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. </li>
    </ol>
